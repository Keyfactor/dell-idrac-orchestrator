Certificate inventory and management for Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller appliances

#### Integration status: Prototype - Demonstration quality. Not for use in customer environments.

## About the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Extension

This repository contains a Universal Orchestrator Extension which is a plugin to the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator. Within the Keyfactor Platform, Orchestrators are used to manage “certificate stores” &mdash; collections of certificates and roots of trust that are found within and used by various applications.

The Universal Orchestrator is part of the Keyfactor software distribution and is available via the Keyfactor customer portal. For general instructions on installing Extensions, see the “Keyfactor Command Orchestrator Installation and Configuration Guide” section of the Keyfactor documentation. For configuration details of this specific Extension see below in this readme.

The Universal Orchestrator is the successor to the Windows Orchestrator. This Orchestrator Extension plugin only works with the Universal Orchestrator and does not work with the Windows Orchestrator.

## PAM Integration

This orchestrator extension has the ability to connect to a variety of supported PAM providers to allow for the retrieval of various client hosted secrets right from the orchestrator server itself.  This eliminates the need to set up the PAM integration on Keyfactor Command which may be in an environment that the client does not want to have access to their PAM provider.

The secrets that this orchestrator extension supports for use with a PAM Provider are:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|ServerUsername|The user id that will be used to authenticate into the server hosting the store|
|ServerPassword|The password that will be used to authenticate into the server hosting the store|
|StorePassword|The optional password used to secure the certificate store being managed|
  

It is not necessary to use a PAM Provider for all of the secrets available above. If a PAM Provider should not be used, simply enter in the actual value to be used, as normal.

If a PAM Provider will be used for one of the fields above, start by referencing the [Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam). The GitHub repo for the PAM Provider to be used contains important information such as the format of the `json` needed. What follows is an example but does not reflect the `json` values for all PAM Providers as they have different "instance" and "initialization" parameter names and values.

### Example PAM Provider Setup

To use a PAM Provider to resolve a field, in this example the __Server Password__ will be resolved by the `Hashicorp-Vault` provider, first install the PAM Provider extension from the [Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) on the Universal Orchestrator.

Next, complete configuration of the PAM Provider on the UO by editing the `manifest.json` of the __PAM Provider__ (e.g. located at extensions/Hashicorp-Vault/manifest.json). The "initialization" parameters need to be entered here:

~~~ json
  "Keyfactor:PAMProviders:Hashicorp-Vault:InitializationInfo": {
    "Host": "http://127.0.0.1:8200",
    "Path": "v1/secret/data",
    "Token": "xxxxxx"
  }
~~~

After these values are entered, the Orchestrator needs to be restarted to pick up the configuration. Now the PAM Provider can be used on other Orchestrator Extensions.

### Use the PAM Provider
With the PAM Provider configured as an extenion on the UO, a `json` object can be passed instead of an actual value to resolve the field with a PAM Provider. Consult the [Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) for the specific format of the `json` object.

To have the __Server Password__ field resolved by the `Hashicorp-Vault` provider, the corresponding `json` object from the `Hashicorp-Vault` extension needs to be copied and filed in with the correct information:

~~~ json
{"Secret":"my-kv-secret","Key":"myServerPassword"}
~~~

This text would be entered in as the value for the __Server Password__, instead of entering in the actual password. The Orchestrator will attempt to use the PAM Provider to retrieve the __Server Password__. If PAM should not be used, just directly enter in the value for the field.

### Prereqs
Orchestrator must run on a Windows Server machine with racadm.exe CLI utility, configured to reach the target IDRAC instance.
Orchestrator must have read and write access to folder with racadm.exe

### Store type
Create a store type with shortname/capability "IDRAC". Select "Add" as supported job type, and check "Needs Server". On advanced, set Private Key Handling: Required. All other defaults are fine, and no parameters are needed.
Default properties have the following meaning:
Store path - Path to folder containing racadm.exe
Client machine - Address of target IDRAC instance
Server username - Username to authenticate racadm.exe to IDRAC
Server password - Password to authenticate racadm.exe to IDRAC

### Supported operations
IDRAC Orchestrator performs inventory operations by executing "racadm.exe sslcertdownload -t ___" with types 1-10.
IDRAC Orchestrator performs management: add jobs by executing "racadm.exe sslkeyupload" and "racadm.exe sslcertupload -t 1". A private key is required to perform the job.
